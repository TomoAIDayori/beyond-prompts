# 🧠 Overview

This repository documents what I learned and built after completing Microsoft's course **"Introduction to Generative AI"** (completed on September 10, 2025).

Rather than stopping at surface-level understanding, this repo focuses on **how generative AI can be practically applied**. It aims to:

- Grasp the *why*, not just the *how* of generative AI
- Implement and test real-world use cases
- Turn learning into **concrete, value-creating projects**

## 🚀 What's Next

Based on this foundational knowledge, I'm planning to extend this repository with:

- A prototype AI tool that generates workflows from natural language
- Experiments on using generative AI to optimize UI/UX design
- Fine-tuning models for Japanese-language specific datasets

## 🙋‍♂️ Why Share This?

Not just to remember what I learned.  
But to **turn traces of learning into professional credibility**.

I hope this inspires others on a similar journey and provides actionable insight.
