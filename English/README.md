## 📐 Principles → Implementation (in 3 lines)
- **Build small, deploy fast**: Minimum viable setup usable in 1 day → Evaluate with metrics the following week
- **Human-centered**: AI drafts, humans decide. Maintain accountability traces (logs/references)
- **Safety is a requirement**: Prioritize designs that avoid collecting personal data (anonymization/minimization)

---

## 🧭 Roadmap (90 days)

1. **Automated workflow construction**: Natural language → Auto-output Zapier/Make drafts (1-click deployment)
2. **UI optimization × Generative AI**: Automated A/B testing for copy/headlines with weekly reports
3. **JP Data-Specific Fine-Tuning**: Establish evaluation metrics and improvement loops for Japanese domains

## 🔧 Stack (Minimal)

- OpenAI API / Python (pandas, FastAPI)
- LangChain (lightweight use only)
